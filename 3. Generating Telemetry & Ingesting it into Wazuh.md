# Objective

The objective of this step is to generate and ingest telemetry from the Windows 10 client machine into the Wazuh server for monitoring and analysis. As part of this process, Wazuh was configured to receive telemetry data, which included activity from Mimikatz. Custom alerts for Mimikatz-related events were successfully triggered, demonstrating Wazuh's ability to detect and respond to potential security threats.

## Step 1:  Configuring Sysmon to Report to Wazuh Dashboard

The objective of this step is to configure Sysmon on the Windows machine to report its telemetry to the Wazuh dashboard. This was achieved by updating the `ossec.conf` file on the Windows client to include the Sysmon log location, followed by restarting the Wazuh service to apply the changes.



### Steps Performed

### 1. Updated the `ossec.conf` File
The `ossec.conf` file on the Windows client was configured to include the Sysmon event log location. This ensures that Sysmon's operational telemetry is sent to the Wazuh server for monitoring.

#### Configuration Added to the `ossec.conf` File:
```xml
<localfile>
  <location>Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational</location>
  <log_format>eventchannel</log_format>
</localfile>

```

### 2. Restarted the Wazuh Service
After updating the `ossec.conf` file, the Wazuh service on the Windows client was restarted to apply the new configuration.

### 3. Verification

After completing the steps, the Windows agent appeared in the Wazuh management interface, confirming successful registration and communication with the server.

Sysmon has been successfully integrated with Wazuh. The Windows client now sends Sysmon telemetry to the Wazuh server, enhancing visibility into system activity and enabling detailed monitoring and analysis.

## Step 2. Configuring Wazuh to Archive and Ingest Logs

This step involved configuring Wazuh to enable JSON logging and to archive all logs, ensuring that activities such as Mimikatz is properly logged and archived for future analysis. A backup of the `ossec.conf` file was created before making changes. Additionally, the Filebeat configuration was updated to support archiving, and the Filebeat service was restarted to apply the changes.

## Steps Performed

### 1. Backed Up the `ossec.conf` File
To ensure that the original configuration could be restored if needed, the `ossec.conf` file was backed up using the following command:

```bash
cp /var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf ~/ossec-backup.conf
```

### 2. Configured the `ossec.conf` File
The `ossec.conf` file was edited to enable JSON logs and archive all logs. These changes ensure that Wazuh captures detailed activity logs, such as those related to Mimikatz, and archives them for future analysis.

#### Changes Made:
- Enabled JSON logging to allow for better log structure and readability.
- Configured Wazuh to archive all logs, ensuring activity logs are stored for long-term analysis.

Archived logs are stored in the following directory:
```bash
/var/ossec/logs/archives

```

### 3. Updated Filebeat Configuration
The Filebeat configuration was edited to enable log archiving, ensuring Wazuh archives all logs for future analysis.

#### Changes Made:
- The `enable_archives` value in the Filebeat configuration file was changed from `false` to `true`.

#### Updated Configuration:
```yaml
enable_archives: true

```

## Step 3. Launched Mimikatz to Generate Telemtry

In this step, Mimikatz was executed to generate telemetry data for analysis. This activity was logged and configured to be visible in the Wazuh Dashboard, providing valuable insights into system behavior and ensuring the effectiveness of the monitoring and logging configurations.

## Step 4. Creating a Custom Rule to Detect Mimikatz Usage

This step involved creating an index pattern in Wazuh to store all archived logs, reviewing the logs to detect Mimikatz activity, and implementing a custom rule to trigger alerts based on the `originalFileName` field. The custom rule was designed to detect and alert whenever the original filename `mimikatz.exe` is launched, even if the filename changes.

## Steps Performed

### 1. Created an Index Pattern in Wazuh
An index pattern was created in the Wazuh dashboard to store and organize all archived logs. This ensured that logs could be efficiently queried and analyzed.

### 2. Reviewed Archived Logs for Mimikatz Activity
After logging into the Wazuh server via SSH, the `archive.logs` file was reviewed to verify that Mimikatz activity had been logged.

#### Command Executed:
```bash
cat /var/ossec/logs/archives/archive.logs
```

### 3. Checked Wazuh for Event ID 1
Event ID 1, which represents process creation events, was reviewed in the Wazuh dashboard. 

#### Steps Taken:
- Navigated to the Wazuh dashboard and searched for Event ID 1 to view process creation logs.
- Located the log generated from launching Mimikatz in the previous step.
- Identified the `originalFileName` field within the log for further rule creation.

This process confirmed that Mimikatz activity was successfully logged and provided the necessary details for creating a custom detection rule.

### 4. Created a Custom Rule
A custom rule was created to detect when the `originalFileName` field in the logs matches `mimikatz.exe`. This ensures that an alert is triggered whenever Mimikatz is launched, even if the filename is changed.

#### Custom Rule Configuration:
```xml
<rule id="100002" level="15">
  <if_group>sysmon_event1</if_group>
  <field name="win.eventdata.originalFileName" type="pcre2">(?i)mimikatz\.exe</field>
  <description>Mimikatz Usage Detected</description>
  <mitre>
    <id>T1003</id>
  </mitre>
</rule>
```

### Changes Made:

- **Rule ID**: Updated to `100002` to indicate a custom rule.
- **Level**: Set to `15` to represent a high-severity alert for testing purposes.
- **Field Name**: Configured as `win.eventdata.originalFileName` to monitor the `originalFileName` field.
- **File Match**: Set to `mimikatz.exe` to trigger alerts whenever the original filename is detected, even if the filename changes.
- **Description**: Updated to `"Mimikatz Usage Detected"` for clarity.
- **MITRE ID**: Set to `T1003` to align with credential dumping techniques.

This custom rule enhances Wazuh's detection capabilities, ensuring that any launch of `mimikatz.exe` is flagged and logged for review.

### 5. Verified the Custom Rule in Wazuh Dashboard
After creating the custom rule, the Wazuh dashboard was used to verify its functionality and review telemetry generated by the rule.

#### Steps Taken:
- Navigated to the Wazuh dashboard.
- Reviewed the logs associated with the custom rule.
- Confirmed that the rule successfully generated an alert whenever `mimikatz.exe` was launched.
- Verified that the alert was triggered based on the `originalFileName` field, ensuring that the rule works even if the filename is altered.

This verification step confirmed that the custom rule operates as intended, providing robust detection for Mimikatz activity.
