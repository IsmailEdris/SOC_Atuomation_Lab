# Objective

The objective of this step is to generate and ingest telemetry from the Windows 10 client machine into the Wazuh server for monitoring and analysis. As part of this process, Wazuh was configured to receive telemetry data, which included activity from Mimikatz. Custom alerts for Mimikatz-related events were successfully triggered, demonstrating Wazuh's ability to detect and respond to potential security threats.

## Step 1:  Configuring Sysmon to Report to Wazuh Dashboard

The objective of this step is to configure Sysmon on the Windows machine to report its telemetry to the Wazuh dashboard. This was achieved by updating the `ossec.conf` file on the Windows client to include the Sysmon log location, followed by restarting the Wazuh service to apply the changes.



### Steps Performed

### 1. Updated the `ossec.conf` File
The `ossec.conf` file on the Windows client was configured to include the Sysmon event log location. This ensures that Sysmon's operational telemetry is sent to the Wazuh server for monitoring.

#### Configuration Added to the `ossec.conf` File:
```xml
<localfile>
  <location>Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational</location>
  <log_format>eventchannel</log_format>
</localfile>

```

### 2. Restarted the Wazuh Service
After updating the `ossec.conf` file, the Wazuh service on the Windows client was restarted to apply the new configuration.

### 3. Verification

After completing the steps, the Windows agent appeared in the Wazuh management interface, confirming successful registration and communication with the server.

Sysmon has been successfully integrated with Wazuh. The Windows client now sends Sysmon telemetry to the Wazuh server, enhancing visibility into system activity and enabling detailed monitoring and analysis.
