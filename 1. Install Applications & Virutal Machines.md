# Objective

The objective of this step is to install the necessary applications and virtual machines needed for this lab. This step involves the deployment of a Windows machine with Sysmon installed, alongside the setup of a Wazuh server and a The Hive server. These installations form the foundational components of the SOC automation lab

## Step 1: Installing Windows with Sysmon

1. Installed Windows 10 Pro with the following configurations:
  - 4GB memory
  - 2 processeors
  - 50 GB storage
  - NAT network connection

## Step 2: Installing Wazuh

In this step, I deployed Wazuh on a DigitalOcean droplet. Wazuh is an open-source security platform that provides threat detection, integrity monitoring, and compliance management. This process involved setting up Ubuntu 22.04 LTS as the server operating system and configuring a secure firewall.

 **Steps Performed** 
 
**1. Deployed an Ubuntu 22.04 LTS Server**
  - I chose Ubuntu 22.04 LTS for its stability, security features, and long-term support. These qualities make it an excellent choice for hosting a critical security platform like Wazuh.

**2. Set Up Firewall Rules**
  
  - I configured the server's firewall to allow only my IP address to connect to all TCP and UDP ports. This rule was added to minimize the server's exposure to unauthorized access and potential attacks. By limiting access to a specific IP, I ensured that only trusted traffic could reach the server, significantly enhancing its security.

**3. Accessed the Droplet via SSH**

  - Used the SSH client to securely connect to the server. Secure Shell (SSH) provides an encrypted connection for remote management.

**4. Updated the System**

  - After logging in, I updated the package lists and installed the latest updates to ensure the server was secure and up-to-date. Keeping the system updated reduces vulnerabilities and provides a stable environment for Wazuh.

**5. Wazuh Installation**

  - Wazuh was installed on the server using the official installation script via a curl command. This method streamlines the setup process by automating dependencies and configurations.

## Step 3: Installing TheHive

TheHive is an open-source security incident response platform designed for case management. It enables teams to track, investigate, and resolve security incidents efficiently while fostering collaboration. This guide outlines the steps to install and configure TheHive on an Ubuntu 22.04 server hosted on DigitalOcean.

**1. Deployed an Ubuntu 22.04 LTS Server**
  - An Ubuntu 22.04 server was deployed on DigitalOcean to host TheHive. This operating system was chosen for its stability, security, and compatibility with TheHive's requirements.

**2. Added the "TheHive" Droplet to the Firewall**
  - I configured the server's firewall to allow only my IP address to connect to all TCP and UDP ports. This rule was added to minimize the server's exposure to unauthorized access and potential attacks. By limiting access to a specific IP, I ensured that only trusted traffic could reach the server, significantly enhancing its security.

**3. Accessed the Server via SSH and Installed Prerequisites**

The server was accessed securely via SSH, and prerequisites for TheHive were installed to ensure proper functionality. The following components were installed:

- Java: Required to run TheHive.
- Cassandra: A distributed database for scalable and reliable data storage.
- Elasticsearch: Used for indexing and searching incident data efficiently.
