# SOC Automation Lab

## Description
This lab is a comprehensive project that builds a fully functional SOC environment from scratch, integrating Wazuh for SIEM and XDR, The Hive for case management, and Shuffle for SOAR capabilities. It highlights expertise in creating a streamlined security ecosystem capable of detecting, managing, and responding to threats with automated workflows and real-time alerting.

The project focuses on:

- Setting up infrastructure in a cloud or virtual environment.
- Configuring and integrating multiple cybersecurity tools.
- Automating detection, containment, and response processes.
- Developing a scalable and functional lab environment, similar to those used in enterprise-level SOCs.

## Key Features of the Lab
