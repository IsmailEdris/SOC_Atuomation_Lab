# Objective

The objective of this step is to integrate Shuffle, a security automation platform, to efficiently send alerts to TheHive, and notify SOC analysts via email. Shuffle is a low-code, open-source security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) platform designed to streamline workflows and enhance incident response capabilities. 

The workflow for automation in this project is as follows: 

1. **Alert Generation**:  
   Wazuh detects the execution of Mimikatz and sends an alert to Shuffle.

2. **Alert Processing**:  
   Shuffle receives the Mimikatz alert and extracts the SHA256 hash from the associated file.

3. **Reputation Check**:  
   Shuffle queries VirusTotal to verify the reputation score of the extracted SHA256 hash.

4. **Alert Forwarding**:  
   Based on the analysis, Shuffle sends the relevant details to TheHive to create an alert for incident management.

5. **Email Notification**:  
   Shuffle triggers an email notification to the SOC analyst, providing details of the Mimikatz alert and its associated findings.

## Step 1: Integrating Wazuh with Shuffle

This step focused on creating a Shuffle workflow to automate the processing of Wazuh alerts. A webhook was configured to send Wazuh alerts to Shuffle, and the `ossec.conf` file on the Wazuh server was updated to forward alerts in JSON format. The changes were verified by viewing the alerts in the Shuffle dashboard.

#### 2. Configured `ossec.conf` on the Wazuh Server
The `ossec.conf` file on the Wazuh server was updated to forward alerts to Shuffle. The following integration block was added to the configuration file:

```xml
<integration>
  <name>shuffle</name>
  <hook_url>https://shuffler.io/api/v1/hooks/webhook_12fdc7ed-c7de-4d1b-aa84-c2411d86d164</hook_url>
  <rule_id>100002</rule_id>
  <alert_format>json</alert_format>
</integration>

```

#### Explanation of Each Tag:

- **`<name>`**: Specifies the name of the integration. Here, "shuffle" is used to indicate that the alerts will be sent to the Shuffle platform.
- **`<hook_url>`**: The webhook URL where Wazuh sends the alerts. This URL corresponds to the webhook configured in the Shuffle workflow.
- **`<rule_id>`**: Specifies the rule ID to filter the alerts being sent. In this case, `100002` is used to only send alerts related to the custom Mimikatz rule.
- **`<alert_format>`**: Defines the format of the alerts. Setting this to `json` ensures that the alerts are sent in JSON format, which is compatible with Shuffle.


#### 3. Restarted and Verified the Wazuh Manager
After updating the `ossec.conf` file, the Wazuh Manager was restarted to apply the changes.

#### Commands Executed:
```bash
# Restart the Wazuh Manager
systemctl restart wazuh-manager.service

# Check the status of the Wazuh Manager
systemctl status wazuh-manager.service

```
