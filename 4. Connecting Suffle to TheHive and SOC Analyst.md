# Objective

The objective of this step is to integrate Shuffle, a security automation platform, to efficiently send alerts to TheHive, and notify SOC analysts via email. Shuffle is a low-code, open-source security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) platform designed to streamline workflows and enhance incident response capabilities. 

The workflow for automation in this project is as follows: 

1. **Alert Generation**:  
   Wazuh detects the execution of Mimikatz and sends an alert to Shuffle.

2. **Alert Processing**:  
   Shuffle receives the Mimikatz alert and extracts the SHA256 hash from the associated file.

3. **Reputation Check**:  
   Shuffle queries VirusTotal to verify the reputation score of the extracted SHA256 hash.

4. **Alert Forwarding**:  
   Based on the analysis, Shuffle sends the relevant details to TheHive to create an alert for incident management.

5. **Email Notification**:  
   Shuffle triggers an email notification to the SOC analyst, providing details of the Mimikatz alert and its associated findings.

## Step 1: Integrating Wazuh with Shuffle

This step focused on creating a Shuffle workflow to automate the processing of Wazuh alerts. A webhook was configured to send Wazuh alerts to Shuffle, and the `ossec.conf` file on the Wazuh server was updated to forward alerts in JSON format. The changes were verified by viewing the alerts in the Shuffle dashboard.

### Steps Performed

#### 1. Created a Shuffle Workflow
- A new Shuffle workflow titled **"SOC Automation Project"** was created. Within this workflow.

- A webhook was configured to receive Wazuh alerts.

- The Shuffle tool was set to repeat back the received alerts by modifying the "call" to "executions."

#### 2. Configured `ossec.conf` on the Wazuh Server
The `ossec.conf` file on the Wazuh server was updated to forward alerts to Shuffle. The following integration block was added to the configuration file:

```xml
<integration>
  <name>shuffle</name>
  <hook_url>https://shuffler.io/api/v1/hooks/webhook_12fdc7ed-c7de-4d1b-aa84-c2411d86d164</hook_url>
  <rule_id>100002</rule_id>
  <alert_format>json</alert_format>
</integration>

```

![afdaf](https://i.imgur.com/oazFQKh.png)

#### Explanation of Each Tag:

- **`<name>`**: Specifies the name of the integration. Here, "shuffle" is used to indicate that the alerts will be sent to the Shuffle platform.
- **`<hook_url>`**: The webhook URL where Wazuh sends the alerts. This URL corresponds to the webhook configured in the Shuffle workflow.
- **`<rule_id>`**: Specifies the rule ID to filter the alerts being sent. In this case, `100002` is used to only send alerts related to the custom Mimikatz rule.
- **`<alert_format>`**: Defines the format of the alerts. Setting this to `json` ensures that the alerts are sent in JSON format, which is compatible with Shuffle.


#### 3. Restarted and Verified the Wazuh Manager
After updating the `ossec.conf` file, the Wazuh Manager was restarted to apply the changes.

#### Commands Executed:
```bash
# Restart the Wazuh Manager
systemctl restart wazuh-manager.service

# Check the status of the Wazuh Manager
systemctl status wazuh-manager.service

```

#### 4. Verified Alerts in the Shuffle Dashboard
After configuring the Wazuh Manager and setting up the integration, the Shuffle dashboard was used to verify that alerts were being received.

#### Steps Taken:
- Navigated to the Shuffle dashboard.
- Confirmed that Wazuh alerts were successfully received through the webhook integration.
- Reviewed the alert details, including:
  - **Severity**: Indicates the importance of the alert (e.g., high severity for Mimikatz detection).
  - **Pretext**: Displays `"Wazuh Alert"` to provide context for the alert.
  - **Title**: Shows `"Mimikatz Usage Detected"` for clarity on what triggered the alert.
  - **Rule ID**: Displays `100002`, which corresponds to the custom rule for detecting Mimikatz activity.
  - **MITRE ID**: Shows `T1003`, aligning the alert with the MITRE ATT&CK framework for credential dumping techniques.
  - **Timestamp**: Logs the exact time the alert was generated.

This verification confirmed that alerts were successfully forwarded from Wazuh to Shuffle and displayed correctly in the dashboard.

## Step 2. Configuring Shuffle to Parse SHA256 Values and Integrate with VirusTotal

This step involved configuring the Shuffle tool to extract the SHA256 file hash value from Wazuh alerts, integrating VirusTotal into the workflow to analyze the hash, and troubleshooting issues with the VirusTotal app. Once fixed, the workflow successfully retrieved and analyzed hash data, identifying malicious activity.

### Steps Performed

### 1. Configured SHA256 Parsing in Shuffle
The Shuffle tool was configured to extract the SHA256 hash from Wazuh alerts using a regex pattern.

#### Changes Made:
- Renamed the default name `"change me"` to `sha256-regex`.
- Set the file actions to `"regex capture group"` to extract specific data from the alert.
- Updated the input data to `"get hashes"`.
- Created a regex pattern to parse the SHA256 value from the alert.

This configuration enabled Shuffle to extract and utilize the SHA256 hash value for further processing.

### 2. Added and Configured VirusTotal App in Shuffle
The VirusTotal app was added to the Shuffle workflow to analyze the extracted hash for malicious activity. The app was authenticated using an API key and configured with the following changes:

#### Changes Made:
- Configured the **"find actions"** to retrieve a hash report.
- Updated the hash input to use the parsed SHA256 value from the `sha256-regex` group created earlier.

### 3. Fixed VirusTotal App URL Issue
After refreshing the workflow, an error code `404` was encountered, indicating that the URL for VirusTotal was incorrect. The issue was resolved by updating the URL in the VirusTotal app configuration:

#### Changes Made:
- Corrected the URL from `/files/reports` to `/files/{id}`.

This fix ensured that the VirusTotal app could successfully retrieve hash data.

---

### 4. Verified VirusTotal Results
After fixing the URL, the workflow was refreshed, and the execution logs were reviewed. The VirusTotal data revealed the following:

- The analyzed hash had a **malicious value of 63**, indicating that the file is highly likely to be malicious.

## Conclusion
The Shuffle tool was successfully configured to extract SHA256 hash values from Wazuh alerts and integrate with VirusTotal to analyze them. Despite an initial error due to an incorrect URL, the issue was resolved, and the workflow was able to retrieve actionable data, highlighting a malicious file with a severity score of 63. This workflow demonstrates the potential for automating malware detection and analysis in a security operations center.
